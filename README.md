I want to use useState at the App. I want to pass all the details like player name and cell details to the GameBoard component to the App Component. Then in App component I compare the score if there is no winner again I update the UI and give the player to play the game. If there is a winner then I pass the winner name to the winnerBox component and update the score at the scoreBox. and lastly redirect the user to the Restart Button.
